Run ./compile.sh to babel files in res folder to here.

Your Jest configuration should point to files in here rather than to the originals in res.
This is due to a wonderful little feature of Jest where it won't run babel on files "outside of its runtime"
(seems to mean anything that isn't a test file). Simplest solution is to babel these files yourself.

 Believe that only jest.config.json will need to use anything in here. In particular, any of globalSetup, globalTeardown and testEnvironment
 need to be babeled before they can be used.
